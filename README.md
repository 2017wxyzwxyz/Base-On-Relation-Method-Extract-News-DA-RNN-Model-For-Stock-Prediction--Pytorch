This model based on:  https://github.com/Zhenye-Na/DA-RNN

We use the 'ta' package to count technical analysis in our data,please reference here: https://github.com/bukosabino/ta


We provide documentation to description how we do and our data come from. We know that there are still much left for improvement,we are trying to make this model better.

GOODONE.pkl is the model we train.
